  % To end this pandemic, a large part of the world needed to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this was through a vaccine, so with the help of investments by companies, governments, international health organizations and university research groups it was possible to develop a series of vaccines including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, among others.

  The first vaccine administered in Portugal was on December 27, 2020. The first person to be inoculated with the first dose of a vaccine was António Sarmento, 65 years old, physician and director of the Infectious Diseases Service, Hospital de São João, in Porto. Since then, more than 2 million doses of vaccine have been administered.
   \\
   Although the entire Portuguese population has access to the vaccine,  Portugal opted for a vaccination plan divided into 3 phases, depending on their vulnerability and clinical picture.  
\\
Priority groups were defined, as an example the health professionals, professionals and residents of residential structures for the elderly and similar institutions, were part of the first phase of vaccination.
