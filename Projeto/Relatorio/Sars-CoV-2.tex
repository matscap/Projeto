As we can read in \cite{covwiki},
"The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 27 June 2021, more than 180 million cases have been confirmed, with more than 3.91 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest pandemics in history."

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, breathing difficulties, loss of smell and taste. 
\\
It's a disease that attacks people of all age and is transmitted mainly by air, via particles that we expel. \\
There are several reasons for the pandemic to spread globally, mainly the fact that a patient may be asymptomatic, which can cause him to transmit the virus without knowing it. For the same reason, the fact that the incubation period is about 14 days is also a factor to be taken into account.
