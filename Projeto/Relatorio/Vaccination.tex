Vaccines are substances made up of pathogens (viruses or bacteria), living or dead, or their derivatives. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies that act against pathogens that cause infections.

Vaccination is a way to protect people from harmful diseases. It uses the body's natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes the
 stronger immune system.
It reduces the possibility of contracting the disease and thus prevents it from spreading.
\\
As soon as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the world, research for the production of safe and effective vaccines began immediately. Vaccination is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and distribute safe and effective vaccines.
\\
Until May 10, 13 vaccines have been authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use. However, in Europe, after consulting the list of authorized vaccines on the official website of the \ac{EU} \cite {EU}, we have four vaccines available: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item BioNTech-Pfizer - (2020/12/21)
    \item Moderna - (2021/01/06)
    \item AstraZeneca - (2021/01/29)
    \item Johnson \& Johnson - (2021/03/11)
\end{itemize}
But it's not the vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it's the vaccination.
