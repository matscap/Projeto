\section{SARS-CoV-2 in Portugal}
\subsection{Brief description}

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) is a new type of coronavirus that causes a respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19, know as COVID-19. It was first detected in December 2019 has quickly spread globally.

Portugal recorded the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 2 and the first death occurred
on March 16. Since then we have added more than 800 thousand registered cases and more than 16 thousand deaths.

Portugal was severely affected by COVID-19, being considered, in the middle of January 2021, as the worst country in the world in terms of infection and mortality rates per million inhabitants and the worst country in Europe with the highest average of cases COVID-19 daily reports, with Portugal reaching a maximum of 16432 cases and 303 deaths on 28 January 2020.












\subsection{Vaccination}

   To end this pandemic, a large part of the world needed to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this was through a vaccine, so with the help of investments by companies, governments, international health organizations and university research groups it was possible to develop a series of vaccines including Phyzer, Moderna, Astrazeneca, Johnson & Johnson, among others.

   The first vaccine administered in Portugal was on December 27, 2020. The first vaccine was António Sarmento, 65, director of the Infectious Diseases Service, at Hospital de São João, in Porto and since then more than 2 million doses of vaccine have been administered. Despite the fact that the entire Portuguese population has access to a vaccine, depending on their clear clinical condition, Portugal opted for a vaccination plan divided into 3 phases, that is, priority groups were defined, as they are more vulnerable to COVID-19, as an example health professionals, professionals and residents of residential structures for the elderly and similar institutions, who were part of the first vaccination phase.
