So far, May 10, 13 vaccines have been authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use. However, in Europe, after consulting the list of authorized vaccines on the \cite {EU} official website of the \ac{EU}, we have four vaccines available: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item BioNTech-Pfizer - (2020/12/21)
    \item Moderna - (2021/01/06)
    \item AstraZeneca - (2021/01/29)
    \item Johnson & Johnson - (2021/03/11)
\end{itemize}

We found a \cite{reuters}good website to track the evolution of vaccine administration globally based on data available at \cite{owd} Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford.
