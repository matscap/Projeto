   To end this pandemic, a large part of the world needed to be immune to the virus. The safest way to achieve this was through a vaccine, so with the help of investments by companies, governments, international health organizations and university research groups it was possible to develop a series of vaccines including Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, among others.

   The first vaccine administered in Portugal was on December 27, 2020. The first vaccine was António Sarmento, 65, director of the Infectious Diseases Service, at Hospital de São João, in Porto and since then more than 2 million doses of vaccine have been administered. Despite the fact that the entire Portuguese population has access to a vaccine, depending on their clear clinical condition, Portugal opted for a vaccination plan divided into 3 phases, that is, priority groups were defined, as they are more vulnerable to COVID-19, as an example health professionals, professionals and residents of residential structures for the elderly and similar institutions, who were part of the first vaccination phase.
